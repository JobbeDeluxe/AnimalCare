[B]AnimalCare v1.1.0[/B]

Now you have to care for every animal: keepers who lock mobs in tiny pens will watch them starve—AnimalCare makes you feed and house your livestock properly, rewarding open pastures and stocked trough barrels while punishing neglected cages.

[B]=== Feature Overview ===[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Automatically maps nearby pens and classifies animals as [B]WILD[/B], [B]PASTURE[/B], or [B]CAPTIVE[/B] by flood-filling open walkable space (default radius: 15 blocks, adjustable vertical tolerance).
[*]Tracks hunger (0–100) for every supported animal via the [I]PersistentDataContainer[/I] with configurable loss/regeneration rates, starvation damage at 0, and breeding locks until animals are fully fed.
[*]Supports manual feeding, hopper loading, and trough automation that only affects configured entities, keeping villagers and NPCs untouched.
[*]Recognises renamed barrels as [COLOR=green][Trough][/COLOR], links double-barrel trough pairs, keeps lids open while stocked, and consumes just enough feed based on per-item energy values.
[*]Ships with bilingual (EN/DE) default messages, an optional debug sword for live diagnostics, and a GitHub Actions workflow that builds on every push or pull request.

[B]=== Usage ===[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Place or rename a barrel to "[Trough]" (double-barrel setups are linked automatically) and stock it with approved feed (wheat, seeds, carrots, potatoes, beetroot, or any item with configured energy).
[*]Right-click the trough to add more food; the automation loop feeds nearby penned animals and updates barrel inventories immediately.
[*]Small enclosures count as [B]CAPTIVE[/B] and drain hunger faster, large pastures become [B]PASTURE[/B], and animals outside any pen remain [B]WILD[/B] at 100 hunger.
[*]Enable the optional debug sword in `config.yml` to inspect trough status, detected animals, and next feed cycles in-game.
[/LIST]

[B]=== Version Highlights ===[/B]
[LIST]
[*]v1.1.0 introduces automatic double-barrel trough pairing with live lid animation, reliable hopper/manual feeding triggers, and visible inventory syncing after every cycle.
[*]Adds wheat seeds as valid feed, honours configured per-item energy so animals eat precisely what they need, and treats every item with an energy value as trough stock.
[*]Hunger processing now filters for explicitly configured entities, and pen detection accepts legacy `GRASS` while defaulting to modern blocks to avoid startup warnings.
[*]Existing servers automatically back-fill new configuration keys during upgrades, preserving custom values.

[B]=== Compatibility & Requirements ===[/B]

[*]Requires access to the PersistentDataContainer API.
[*]No external databases required.
