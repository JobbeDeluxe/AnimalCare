[B]=== Features / Funktionen ===[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Automatic pen scanning classifies animals as [B]WILD[/B], [B]PASTURE[/B], or [B]CAPTIVE[/B] based on solid blocks within the configurable radius (default 15).
[*]Persistent hunger system (0–100) stored in the [I]PersistentDataContainer[/I] with configurable loss/regeneration and starvation damage at 0.
[*]Hand feeding and trough feeding only work for penned animals and trigger breeding once hunger reaches 100.
[*]Barrel troughs (rename to [COLOR=green][Trough][/COLOR]) consume stored food items and feed nearby animals automatically.
[*]Bilingual defaults (German/English) plus a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the plugin on every push or pull request.

[B]=== Configuration Snippet ===[/B]
[CODE]
pen:
  detection-radius: 15
  min-pen-size-xz: 12
hunger:
  captive-loss: 6
  pasture-change: -1
trough:
  name-tag: "[Trough]"
  max-feed-per-cycle: 4
[/CODE]

[B]=== Usage ===[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Place or rename a barrel to [Trough] and stock it with allowed feed items (wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroot).
[*]Right-click the barrel with more feed to load it; the trough consumes items and restores hunger for nearby animals inside pens.
[*]Animals in pens smaller than the configured size are treated as CAPTIVE and lose hunger faster than those in large pastures.
[*]Animals outside any enclosure stay WILD and keep their hunger at 100.
